## ✨ Features

- ✅ Direct import from LMU `.duckdb` telemetry files
- ✅ **Single unified MoTeC log** output (`*_CUSTOM.ld`)
- ✅ Logical channel groups selectable from GUI:
  - Driver / Inputs
  - Powertrain
  - Vehicle Dynamics
  - Aero & Suspension
  - Tyres
  - Track & Environment
  - States & Flags
- ✅ Configurable sampling frequency per group
- ✅ Correct master timeline (no broken graphs)
- ✅ Professional channel naming:
  - Wheels: **FL / FR / RL / RR**
  - Sides: **_L / _R**
  - Tyre layers: **_I / _M / _O**
- ✅ Consistent units:
  - Temperatures: **°C**
  - Pressures: **bar**
  - Heights / suspension: **mm**
  - Speed: **km/h**
  - Engine speed: **rpm**
- ✅ Simple **one-click GUI**

## 🖥️ Requirements

- **Windows**
- **Python 3.10+** (with Tkinter, included in the official installer)

### Quick install (recommended)

1. Install Python 3.10 or newer and make sure it's available in your PATH.
2. Double-click `install_dependencies.bat` to create a virtual environment and install all required packages.
3. Launch the GUI with `Start.bat` (it will automatically use the virtual environment when present).

### Manual install

Install the dependencies directly if you prefer not to use the helper script:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Tkinter is included with the official Windows Python distribution.

🚀 Quick Start
Clone or download this repository

Make sure Python is available in your PATH

Launch the GUI with:

Copia codice
oneclick.bat
Select an LMU .duckdb telemetry file

Choose channel groups and sampling frequencies

Click RUN

📂 Output files will be created in:

php-template
Copia codice
Telemetry/
  <SessionName>_CUSTOM.ld
  <SessionName>_CUSTOM.csv
  <SessionName>_CUSTOM.meta.csv
Open the .ld file directly in MoTeC i2.

📊 MoTeC Output
Single, coherent telemetry log

Channels already renamed and grouped

Beacon and LapTime generated automatically

Ready for overlays, histograms and math channels
